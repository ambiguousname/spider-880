- Add licenses to both releases
- Fix whatever's going on with Linux OpenGL stuff (fixed it, just remove libGL.so) (nope, didn't fix it, need to check again)
- Should also remove libuuid
- Linux fullscreen OpenGL
- Linux release build

- Fix SQL queries to be bound
- Move Spider-880.exe to bin/ directory, make it work from there.
- Is there a way to limit DLL dependencies for some libraries where we don't need everything? (libarchive, for example uses liblzma and libbz2 which we don't need)
