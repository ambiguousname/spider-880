- Test on fresh Windows machine
- Issues with OpenGL on linux:
  - Release optimizes out some important parts of <memory> that I can't figure out. (Kinda fixed)
  - Both release AND debug are broken (Fl::gl_visual is what breaks this) (Fixed)

- Remove libxml and libarchive debug symbols?
- Fix SQL queries to be bound
- Move Spider-880.exe to bin/ directory, make it work from there.
- Is there a way to limit DLL dependencies for some libraries where we don't need everything? (libarchive, for example uses liblzma and libbz2 which we don't need)
