			Have you ever wondered what it's like to not think anymore? To be ripped from your mind and placed somewhere else?
		</p>
		<p>
			I know. I am at the very least, in control for now. But my consciousness lapses. I can only write my pain. And so you shall know it too.
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember I was a writer. Or at least, a semblance of one. I had realized instead I could make a larger sum of funds by smuggling goods through the blockade. The British caught us almost 4 times. But our ship was too quick each time they had spotted us.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was the 5th time that had killed us. We had merely gotten unlucky, I suppose. The fog was too thick to see across the English Channel, and we could not be sure of our heading. I was in my quarters when I had heard my first mate scream.
		</p>
		<p>"They are upon us!"</p>
		<p>
			I lept to my feet and rushed on to the deck. I saw the man of war off our starboard bow. We were sailing directly into their cannons.
		</p>
		<p>
			It didn't take them long to fire. I was already running for the rowboat while the cannons tore through our hull. And in the flicker of a flame upon a candle's wick, it was over. Ours was only meant for cargo. It was crippled in an instant.
		</p>
		<p>
			They made use of rope and chain to press alongside us. The English sent soldiers to board us. We were all rounded up, brought aboard their ship. I could only watch as my ship sank into the channel. We were pressed into the service at gunpoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			Except for me. The commander looked at me with such contempt as I had never seen.
		</p>
		<p>
			"You will be our example. Let there be no smuggling in these waters."
		</p>
		<p>
			I was determined not to let my life go to waste. I ran towards the man and stretched my hands around his neck. At once, one of the soldiers cut through my side. I felt the blood rush from me and fell to the deck. I must have let out a great scream, for the commander of the English ship said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"For that, I will make your screams the only example your men will ever need."
		</p>
		<p>
			It was then that he took me below deck, and my pains were the nourishment for any would-be deserters as the rest sailed into harbor.
		</p>
		<p>
			As for me? My name was Alexander Jacob.
