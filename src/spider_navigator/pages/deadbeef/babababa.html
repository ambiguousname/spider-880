			They give the bogeyman many names.
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember my mother called him Zs√°kos Ember. A man who would take the children who misbehaved and put him into his sack.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm sure you've heard the same story or other.
		</p>
		<p>
			He who punishes the wicked, the disobedient. He'll snatch you up and carry you to his home. They never say where he lives, or what lies there. That was always left to my imagination.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm sure it was nothing good. And I'm doubly sure that it was a story to make sure I soaked our dishes, went to school on time, and ate everything that was on my plate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I've still seen the man with the sack. But to call it a man does it a disservice. It comports itself in the shape of one yes. It has the skin of a man, the teeth of a man, and it even bleeds like a man. But the key distinction that separates this intelligence from our bodies is twofold.
		</p>
		<p>
			But first, my story: I worked as a phone line technician for Ma Bell. One day I was charged with repairing several of the lines that had been severed during a thunderstorm. And so as I got to work on the streets of Rorik's End, I noticed a flaw in the system. I will not bore you with the specifics, such as they are. But the imperfection was a guiding string. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It drew me to a small apartment block, not more than 3 stories. The basement of the block had the usual setup. Phone lines being conveyed from one such end to another. The only peculiar thing that bid me investigate further was a setup such that I would be drawn to the roof. A great many wires routed to direct an individual into and out of phone communications for nearly the whole city.
		</p>
		<p>
			In compliance with my duties as a company man, I marched up the stairs. As I opened the door to the roof, I was not prepared for what my eyes witnessed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead of a roof with a ceiling stretching out to the sky, there was a great and vast ballroom. I judged it to be the size of a football field in length and width, albeit with many adjoining doors on all sides. In the center was the thing. Above it hung a mighty chandelier that swayed from no breeze at all. At once, I saw the distinguishing features.
		</p>
		<p>
			One. The terrible stench. It smelled as though someone had left fish to rot in a windowless room for a full year. I expelled the contents of my lunch on the odors entering my nose.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two. It was paralyzed below the neck. Or at least, seemingly so.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know no man that has not been in full control of his faculties and common decency. This man was unkempt, deliberately and evilly so, in a manner that compelled me to flee. Yet I found myself unable to move.
		</p>
		<p>
			It held in one hand, a phone. And in the other, a bag.
		</p>
		<p>
			I felt myself unable to move as I watched him grip the phone with one disgusting hand. Each nail measured the length of my foot. I stood still for a full minute as it spoke no words. Only glancing at me. I will never forget the uncaring boredom I beheld. I was nothing but party to its whims.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, it set the bag aside. With the other hand did it place on the handset. From there it set about pulling and tugging. And to my surprise, out came a man in full business dress and attire.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was screaming and kicking in shock, demanding to know where he was and what was happening to him. The unkempt thing only regarded him with a look, and on receipt of his gaze the kicking and screaming ceased.
		</p>
		<p>
			The thing bit into his skull, and began carving out a hearty meal for itself. Biting through flesh and sinew and bone until it had sated itself on the man's body. Placing the leftovers into the bag it had set aside.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ask you. In the land of monsters and creatures beyond your wildest imagining, is there still such a thing as a liar?
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm sure my mother had never seen the bogeyman in her life. She had never known danger as there exists. She was only repeating the stories she had heard before. The stories of wild shapes and things that I know have never and will never exist. She had never seen the bogeyman, and neither had the old men sitting by the campfire thinking of ways for their children to behave themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yet, in spite of that lie, I still call it the bogeyman. My mother would be disappointed for my americanization of the term, but I doubt it matters much.
		</p>
		<p color="13">
			He is dead, and so did she also, die.
		</p>
		<p color="13">
			I struck a bargain so the phone technician, though his heart be set on mediocre writing, may tell his story one more time before his soul must return to my domain.
		</p>
		<p color="13">
			As for your concerns: It's a shame the amount of bodies that have been piling up in your droll town. Rorik's End is such a suitable place for murderer, but not as it is experiencing presently.
		</p>
		<p color="13">
			Oft am I in the mood for bargains. As I salvaged this man's memory, as I gave Rorik Andersen recompense for his sins, so too am I able to bargain with you.
		</p>
		<p color="13">
			If happenstance brings you to my doorstep again, perhaps we can aid each other.
