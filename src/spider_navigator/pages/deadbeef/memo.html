			BUREAU OF SABOTAGE
		</p>
		<p>
			INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
		</p>
		<p>
			George K. Anderson
		</p>
		<p>
			Subject: "The Cost of Business"
		</p>
		<p>
			I'd like to take this moment to welcome, officially, all hands onto deck. The Bureau of Sabotage will be an experiment replicated nationwide, provided we all commit ourselves to the course.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the spirit of such things, I want to acknowledge the hard work being done by our colleagues at Spider Computing.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of now, you should find yourselves equipped with the very latest in your field. Rorik's End has gratefully budgeteted us $150 million, with another $150 million matched from our partners at Standard Combustion.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this greater investment comes a greater responsibility. It is your perogative to, at all costs, avoid divestment from Standard Combustion's assets. Inter-Employee communications and consultations within Standard Combustion's portfolio of investments are at dangerous levels, and we expect action from any branch at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the first word of any organization amongst Standard Combustion's contractors or full time staff, please immediately report to your supervisor.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also want to remind you all of our founding objectives. Criminal activity and drug use are at an all time high, and anything that can be done to intercept and disrupt communications amongst potential terrorists and traitors to our government are actions by which I will abide.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your assignments should be distributed now. Your country honors you.
		</p>
		<p>
			God's speed, gentlemen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, I've paid around $10k out of pocket to play "For Those About to Rock" on the speaker system for your appreciation of its application to our work ethic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, actually. $3k of that went to getting the rights. And then my wife wanted me to play "The Time of My Life, so that was $6k. And then $100 to get my cousin Eddy to mix the two together.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you enjoy, it will be broadcast this afternoon during your lunch break.
		</p>
