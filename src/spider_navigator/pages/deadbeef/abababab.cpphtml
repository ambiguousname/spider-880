			BUREAU OF SABOTAGE
		</p>
		<p>
			INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
		</p>
		<p>
			George K. Anderson
		</p>
		<p>
			Subject: "The Cost of Business"
		</p>
		<p>
			I'd like to take this moment to welcome, officially, all hands onto deck. The Bureau of Sabotage will be an experiment replicated nationwide, provided we all commit ourselves to the course.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the spirit of such things, I want to acknowledge the hard work being done by our colleagues at Spider Computing.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of now, you should find yourselves equipped with the very latest in your field. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, I've paid around $10k out of pocket to play "For Those About to Rock" on the speaker system for your appreciation of its application to our work ethic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, actually. $3k of that went to getting the rights. And then my wife wanted me to play "The Time of My Life, so that was $6k. And then $100 to get my cousin Eddy to mix the two together.
