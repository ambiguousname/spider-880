			I went spelunking with my friend Luke the other day.
		</p>
		<p>
			We've gone a few times. I don't live close to Egg Park, so it takes about an hour to make the drive up.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Careful!" Luke shouts. I've slammed the door; he's particularly sensitive about the new coat of paint.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Sorry." I turn to the entrance. It's Egg Cave. The place reeks of sulfur, but it's by far the safest place to spelunk. Wide open spaces, a central cavern that connects all paths, and very few dead ends. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I do a quick check to make sure all our gear's there. Lights? Helmets? All the basic stuff is there. Plus, my goat stake for luck. My plan is not to blow anyone's mind with our thoroughness. We're just here to have fun. "We're good."
		</p>
		<p>
			We make our way into the tunnel that connects to the central cavern. It's a short walk through a somewhat cramped tunnel, but it opens up quickly. The view from the central cavern is always amazing.
		</p>
		<p>
			As caverns go, it's stunning. The ceiling is so high, you can't even touch it with your fingers. The surface is smooth, flat, and dry. I am told that it was a lot more damp and dangerous, but Andersen Mining was interested in using this space as an investor showroom. That's the story, anyways. It didn't really pan out, since the rest of the caves were abandoned for who knows what reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's the closest thing to a show cave that you can get, without the nuisance of tour guides or guardrails. Perfect for getting started.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Usual route?" I ask.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I actually have something more interesting in mind. See that there?" Luke points to a tunnel off to the side. "I've been checking my map and consulting on the IRC. Really cool mineral formations that way. And still big enough to fit us both."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Didn't we take a look the second time? I thought it was a dead end."
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, that's a trick of the rocks. It actually bends around. Come look."
		</p>
		<p>
			I head over to the tunnel, and make a thorough examination. The rocks bend out of the way. "Let's go, then."
		</p>
		<p>
			We're inching down the tunnel. There's hardly any room for Luke and myself. "I think it's a few more feet."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Well, so far this is a total disappointment." But I catch a glimmer of something up ahead.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Look! Minerals!"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Okay, I guess you weren't pulling my leg. There are more down this way?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, and it'll open up as we go on."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So it does." I reach the edge of the tunnel, and my light shines to reveal the opening of the cavern. "I thought there were gonna be more mineral formations though?" I step out into the opening.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Further down, I think." Luke steps out to join me. "Hey, anyone else know we're here?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I think my sister knows I go caving. It's a little too embarrassing to tell my folks though. They worry too much."
		</p>
		<p>
			"But you didn't tell her that we came out today?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why do you want to know?" I turn to face him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Sorry. I think this is making me a little contemplative. I mean, if I died here, you're the only one who would know."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Well, I'd go and get help if you got hurt. No need to go that dark."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yeah. Sorry, again."
		</p>
		<p>
			We continue along the open cavern, making our way past the various rock formations. You know, the many stalagmites and stalactites. I haven't even drawn up a will for if I die. Where's all my stuff gonna go?
		</p>
		<p>
			I think Luke is thinking the same thing. I catch him a few times not looking at his footing. "Careful."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'm really sorry. Again."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Just drop it, okay? Let's just enjoy the minerals." I pause to look around. "If we can find any." The cave is slowly losing its appeal. The ground starts to look more slimy and glossy the farther we go in. "In about a minute though, I'm turning us around."
		</p>
		<p>
			We reach an opening with a drop. It's far down enough to break your leg. I catch Luke's hands moving out of the corner of my eye, and spin to face him.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hold onto his wrists and drag him with me as we fall to the floor. "LUKE!" I scream.
		</p>
		<p>
			He remains silent as he grabs my neck and chokes me.
		</p>
		<p>
			My hands reach for my neck and I try to free myself from his grip. He's too strong.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I knee him in the balls. For that, he lets out a screech. Gasping, I crawl away.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel my breath grow deeper as I try to stand up. Luke grabs me and impales my chest on the stalagmite.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'm sorry, Jess." I hear behind me. "We're accepting the buyout. You were the majority hold-out. We'll convince your family to sell or vote 'yes'."
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't even know if I can feel rage anymore. Everything that made me is pooling onto the floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I just thought you should know why. It's $500k. No way I can turn that down."
		</p>
		<p>
			I am in agony.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can't even tell when Luke leaves. I can only focus on the life that is leaving me. I would scream, but I don't even have strength left for that.
		</p>
		<p color="1">
			So something else does for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cavern I am in is nothing but rock. I can feel the stuff it's made from. It's as easily bent as paper.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can still feel Luke's presence in the cave. I add my voice to that of the scream, to twist the cavern upside-down and inside-out to try and break the bastard on the walls.
		</p>
		<p>
			I can feel him scrambling on the walls, trying to find his way back to the entrance. It's like having a termite crawl inside your stomach.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spend minute after minute trying to find the bug and squash it for good. But the rage and anger I'm feeling is subsiding. The things that are driving me are losing their patience. And we stop.
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't get him. He's still here. And so am I.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was Jessica Reyes.
		</p>

			I have been murdered.
