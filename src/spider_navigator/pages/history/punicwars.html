				THE PUNIC WARS are a fascinating section of history, for the genius of the western men involved and the scale of the giants that came into focus.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the one hand, was Carthage. A vicious giant, a master of unspeakable cruelty. Carthaginians owned slaves, suppressed revolts, and were determined to spread as far as they could.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other, the Roman Republic. A true and pure democracy, Rome at this point had only involved itself in defensive conflicts to prevent aggression, and here was no different. Carthage would have to be taught a lesson.
			</p>
			<p>
				Carthaginians had the upper hand. Their fleets were massive, and well experienced. They controlled a much larger section of the Mediterranean than Rome.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so begins the great conflict of our the ancient age. Had these wars gone any differently, you or I might not exist at all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				More coming soon!
