			SPIDER COMPUTING TO ACQUIRE OF STAR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
		</p>
		<p>
			In a shareholders' meeting yesterday, Standard Combustion announced it would be buying Star Information Systems to the sum of around $500,000 and integrating it with their Spider Computing division. "We're so proud to be able to integrate the experiences of a Spider Desktop Computer with Star Information Systems' revolutionary new Ouranos system. We can expect a great edge over our competitors within the next fiscal year." Said Jonathan Plinkett, current President of Spider Computing.

			Co-Founder Lucas Schiff had this to say at the meeting: "I am thrilled that we are able to supplement Spider's already great catalog of products. Ouranos will mark a massive improvement in performance and power. The future is now, and we can only go forward from here."
