			SPIDER COMPUTING TO ACQUIRE OF STAR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
		</p>
		<p>
			In a shareholders' meeting, Standard Combustion announced it would be buying Star Information Systems to the sum of around $500,000 and integrating it with their Spider Computing division. "We're so proud to be able to integrate the experiences of a Spider Desktop Computer with Star Information Systems' revolutionary new Ouranos system. We can expect a great edge over our competitors as we integrate with our new models." Said Jonathan Plinkett.

			Co-Founder Lucas Schiff had this to say at the meeting: "I am thrilled that we are able to supplement Spider's already great catalog of products. Ouranos will mark a massive improvement in performance and power. The future is now, and we can only go forward from here."

			Spider Computing wowed attendees with its latest model, the Spider 2000. "We wanted a computer built for the future." Said Jonathan Plinkett, unveiling its specs:

			64-bit Computing, 32-bit color, 512 KB of RAM, a whopping megabyte of storage, and a clock rate of 2 MHz.
			
			Jonathan Plinkett had more to show off, however. "I was told by the R&D guys not to overpromise, but let me tell you this: this is the model of the future, for your business. We aren't pulling any tricks here: there is no smoke, there are no mirrors. You can expect this life-changing technology by Quarter 3 of next year. And we'll be retailing only for $800."

			Truly an amazing innovation in the computing market.

			SHIFT IN LEADERSHIP

			Hi all. Since Engounge has left, expect some changes in administration policy. Specifically, you'll have a new moderator, and expect more Spider Computing focused news. All relevant bulletins and messages will be deleted for their violation of internal Spider Computing company policies. Remember that the Spider Computing BBS does not condone any inappropriate content with regards to our internal policies.
