			Spider Computing was founded as the Spider Speculative Business Unit in 1968 by Standard Combustion to explore potential investment opportunities in an ever-shifting market. We found a home with the transistor. Since then, we've been aggressively taking the personal and business computing market by storm with our yearly releases of the Spider series.
