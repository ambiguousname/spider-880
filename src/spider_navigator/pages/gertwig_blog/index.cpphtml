			Hi! I'm Brian.

		<p>
			I've been playing with this stuff for a long while now. I started on punchcards, I'm now on database management for the Bureau of Sabotage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently developing the Bureau of Sabotage Network Navigator as a spare time project.
		</p>
		<p>
			My apologies to everyone currently using NavSab. You can see the issues being tracked here: <a href="gertwig_blog/navsab"></a>
