			Hi! I'm Brian.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've been playing with this stuff for a long while now. I started on punchcards, I'm now on database management for the Bureau of Sabotage. I'm running this server on my home BSD distribution right now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently developing the Bureau of Sabotage Network Navigator as a spare time project.
		</p>
		<p>
			My apologies to everyone currently using NavSab. You can see NavSab's development here: <a href="gertwig_blog/navsab">NavSab Development</a>
