			The current page for NavSab. Plans are in development for making it open source.
		</p>
		<p>
			The major issue is the BuSab Internal C Compiler. The binaries are only compatible with Spider-500+, and only on BuSab models. BuSab OS screens the machine code to verify that a compiled program has an encrypted checksum generated from the BICC. And there are some C features that are wholly unique to BICC.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a pain, but if any other BuSab members want to reach out (especially with valid checksum generators, or any custom compiler kits), let me know. I could really use the help.
		</p>
		<p>
			Networking is in at the very least, so you can view webpages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Urgent Bugs:
		</p>
		<p>
			Loading &lt;a&gt; tags from Mirror's output are not consistent with real links, reducing them to plaintext for now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Major memory leakage for Spider-760s.
		</p>
		<p>
			Typing "DEADBEEF" into a NavSab window causes a crash.
		</p>
		<p>
			Would be nice to have:
		</p>
		<p>
			In-built padding that doesn't leave awkward whitespace from &lt;style&gt; tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maximize button that doesn't screw up sizing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Proper text wrapping.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following that, text you can actually select and copy. I know because I sometimes have trouble reading these webpages myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fully centered (and resizing) text.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not all HTML tags are supported (lists, plaintext, headers, etc.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Things I can't fix:
		</p>
		<p>
			Swearing is blocked as per <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>.
