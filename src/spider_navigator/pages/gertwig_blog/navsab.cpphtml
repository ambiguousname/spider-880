			The current page for NavSab. Plans are in development for making it open source. The major issue is the BuSab Internal C Compiler. The binaries are only compatible with Spider-500+, and only on BuSab models. BuSab OS screens the machine code to verify that a compiled program has an encrypted checksum generated from the BICC. And there are some C features that are wholly unique to BICC. It's a pain, but if any other BuSab members want to reach out (especially with valid checksum generators, or any custom compiler kits), let me know. I could really use the help.

			Networking is in at the very least, so you can view webpages.

		<p>
			Urgent Bugs:
		</p>
		<p>
			Multiple rendering issues - Image coloring and text positioning don't work on the first pass.
		</p>
		<p>
			Major memory leakage for Spider-760s.
		</p>
		<p>
			Typing "DEADBEEF" into NavSab window causes a crash.
		</p>
		<p>
			Would be nice to have:
		</p>
		<p>
			Proper text wrapping.
		</p>
