Alright, let's try to find a semblance of order so we know what needs to get finished.

1. 5coolbeans site (info on SIS, maybe info on earnings or living status? At least that they're in the same Area/Subarea that SIS is in.)
2. Lschiff site (info on SIS, structured more like a resume)
3. Gertwig site (map of Rorik's End? Good reason for why they might go missing)
4. UBBS
 a. System Bulletin. Disappearance of lschiff, Gertwig, and 5coolbeans. (Done)
 b. User Bulletin. Details from lschiff and 5coolbeans about going caving (Done, sort of). Maybe some income discussion from all the murder victim suspects (Done). Details from engounge about finding the body (with the detail from 5coolbeans?).
5. Spider BBS
 a. System Bulletin. Spider acquisition of SIS (done).
 b. User Bulletin. Lschiff talks about living situation (and mentions 5coolbeans' as well, maybe hint that they're gonna go caving together). Banned post about the Rorik End Strangler with a mod reminder to stay safe.
6. Endemic Thunderspasm
 a. Murders in Rorik's End, Part 1. About the Rorik End Strangler.
7. SIS
 a. Some detail from 5coolbeans that would be able to positively identify their body (is there another place this could fit? Maybe the SIS site?).
