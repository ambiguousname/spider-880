			Anyone here see A Nightmare on Elm Street? Friday the 13th? 
		</p>
		<p>
			What about Silent Night, Deadly Night? Killer Workout? No? Or E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial?
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm not kidding around. 15 minutes after credits roll, that <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> turns the ship around and sticks his finger up the <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> of those kids. Or anyone too stuck-up to appreciate the childlike wonder and <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY100</a>-spewing goodness of Steven Spielberg's leftover <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>. I say this not just for shock value, but to prepare you for some truly shocking news. Worse than that sneak-preview of E.T. 2 (coming to theaters this summer!)

			There's been another murder in Rorik's End. In other news, water is wet. And my <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY100</a> hasn't dropped yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's a pattern with these latest ones though. Police are calling him "the slasher" in a fit of creativity as rare as a unicorn <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> bricks in a nice salsa.

			Because the thing is, he slashes his victms. Around the neck. As I said, the inventiveness has really been kicked up a notch these days. Let's just hope he doesn't have any mommy issues, otherwise we'd really have to use our brains.

			Remember those films I was talking about earlier? I don't. The skinny of this sandwich that I'm slicing for you is, if you're going out at night. Go with someone. As long as they're going to kill you the second you turn your back.
