			Congratulations to our BuSab patriots!

			This is a page that exists only with NavSab. BuSab encrypts internal network traffic; I guess to avoid leaks. I'm aware of a few different ways to encrypt network traffic without requiring the user to input a password, but BuSab (unsurprisingly) has its own weird and unique way of doing things. I have to encrypt each page by hand myself before uploading it to the network.

			Lame.

			I actually used to work for BuSab back when it was the posterboy for "Safe Computing for Everyone". You used to be able to dial into any number for any amount of time, no charge. For the purposes of security. In Rorik's End's Bureau of Sabotage. To be young and made of money; the Standard Combustion backing had its enormous uses.

			The reasons for my leaving are personal, but I will say: get out while you can. I'd like to at least thank my mentor, Brian Gertwig, for helping me survive my final few days of torment.

			If you're looking for a job and haven't been to any of BuSab's Christmas parties, come talk to me! We're making good money; I just got a sick new pick for rock climbing.

			Brian engraved a ram or some such on the hilt. For headbutting the competition away :). Thanks Brian!
