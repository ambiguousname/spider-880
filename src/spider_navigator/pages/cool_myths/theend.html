			As a native of Rorik's End myself, there's a somewhat buried tale about Rorik Andersen himself that I think deserves attention. It comes from his grandniece (on his wife's side): Eliza Anderson's "History of the Andersens" (1962). I've excerpted the relevant portions here, but for contex the story itself takes place after he filed for bankruptcy and sold Andersen Mining:
		</p>
		<p>
			What follows is an amalgamation of records of speculation from local sources (mostly rumor mills), and my grandmother's own recollection of what her brother-in-law said at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rorik decided to walk home after a long day in court, and for whatever reason decided to make a detour. He recalled swinging by the Emerald Meadows (colloquially known as Egg Park), and encountering a man with an apparently long coat.
		</p>
		<p>
			The man asks Rorik what he's doing there.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I own this park. Haven't you heard of me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The man says he has. But he says it's not Rorik's park, and something to the effect that it belongs to the city.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Show some respect for your betters."
		</p>
		<p>
			The man assaults Rorik, and there's a scuffle. Rorik shows up to the police station about an hour later, very beaten and bruised. He claims to have driven the other man off, and eventually returns home.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next day, Rorik orders newspapers to run a front-page piece the next day, the headline reading: "Death to Traitors".
		</p>
		<p>
			The content of the article is a matter of public record, and one I will not repeat here.
		</p>
		<p>
			What was not in the public record, is my grandmother's sole recollection of Rorik's behavior on the night in question. He apparently called my grandmother to let her know that our family was to be disinherited.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only other thing my grandmother remembers from that conversation was Rorik panicking about his substantial debts: 
		</p>
		<p>
			"They're being called due. I can't afford to pay. I hear scratching about the walls. You've always been a kind sort, and for that your judgement will not be to-day. For my life, murderes and thieves be about. I'll let them not take house or home. The walls are alive. And I can hear them claw for my life."
		</p>
		<p>
			He refused entry to anyone but his servants. Rorik was found dead 3 weeks later, ruled a suicide.
