			qwer324: <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			drydock_: this is <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>. mirrors gunna be dead in a month.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: its literally groundbreaking, every BBS in roriks end is using it.
		</p>
		<p>
			drydock_: yeah because there are only like 5 people who run bbses here, and they all know each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: yeah look at the HTML pages. You can only see message content and sender info. Everything just gets blended into noise
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: drydock has a point, it's too tight-knit for anyone to say different.
		</p>
		<p>
			drydock_: And he agrees with me for once. <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY400</a>. was that so hard?
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: yes, actually. <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Okay, I'm cutting things off here.
		</p>
		<p>
			drydock_: Way to spoil the mood. Did you have to just delete mine?
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Watch it, or I'll keep deleting.
		</p>
		<p>
			drydock_: I notice you didn't delete 5coolbeans messages.
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: thanks
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Yeah, no prob.
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Topic for the day. Any plans for the weekend?
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Actually gonna play some board games with lschiff
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: sounds cool, any fun ones?
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Ill call him and tell him to log on
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: Sup. Yeah, Wiz-War with like two other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: Boooooo. Steve Jackson has y'all covered. Car Wars, easy.
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: I don't want to get bogged down in turning rates, no thanks.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: You guys are literally <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> bonkers, coo-coo bananas. You can build youre own car. I kitted my <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> out, lined my chassis with micromissiles. blew <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> up last week, owned all those <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> down at the game shop. 
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: I *just* got the box, I'm not buying something else.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: If you really want to bore yourselves to death, you could just play Labyrinth.
		</p>
		<p>
			absdeaf: labyrinths for kids <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: I know that, <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a>. I was just naming some examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: we are just going to play Wiz-War
		</p>
		<p>
			absdeaf: BOOOOOOORING a&a is a real game for real players
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: Pretty sure we just wanna play wiz war
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: I'll change the topic again. Anyone doing some cool stuff outside?
		</p>
		<p>
			asdeaf: You speak to the nerds as if we have anything better to do with our time than stay inside
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Speak for yourself, I go rock climbing pretty regularly
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: Oh, and I've started spelunking some.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: that's siiiick
		</p>
		<p>
			freeoccram: yeah i don't think anyone else has anything to say. Guess we're all just stuck to our computers.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: anyone hear they fired engounge from spider? what the <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> was with that?
		</p>
		<p>
			freeoccram: They found <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY100</a> in his desk.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: oh. i see.
		</p>
		<p>
			freeoccram: AND AND he was posting about it on the Spider BBS too. They called the police n everything
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: woah, that's crazy
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: We also banned engounge here for the same reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			brian.: Wow.
		</p>
		<p>
			absdeaf: <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> crazy dudes
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: Called it
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Can't believe it. What are they gonna do with him?
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Whatever the police do with predators, I guess.
		</p>
		<p>
			absdeaf: please <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY400</a> death penalty
		</p>
		<p>
			brian.: Hey, I've been at my job for a while now. Our town council just signed a law to cut our salaries. I'm a database administrator at the Bureau of Sabotage, so for anyone at similar positions: are you seeing the same? 
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: I think that's just you, dude
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: At SIS we use a database for test results of our products. I think we pay our administrator around $40k a year?
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Yeah, although we run a pretty tight ship. I barely make over $50k. I think for the bigger companies like Spider, it's definitely more.
		</p>
		<p>
			freeoccram: I make around $60k working where I am.
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: I am <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> envious living with my mom making $200 a week.
		</p>
		<p>
			brian.: Sorry, didn't mean to make this a general income discussion. Just sad to say I make way less. Even without the cut I'm at $20k annually.
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: That sucks man.
		</p>
		<p>
			freeoccram: I'm real sorry, dude.
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: We could help you find a job elsewhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			brian.: I would really appreciate it. But we'll see what happens.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: hey i've thought about it some. 5coolbeans, lschiff, what sort of gear do you use when you go outside? thinkin about doing some outside stuff myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			5coolbeans: Not that much. I'm into this mostly as a hobby, and I don't want to spend too much. So I've spent enough on basic stuff, like the shoes, harness, if you go int oany store they'll get you hooked up. oh, and water is important. I've only done face climbs, though.
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: I think it's the same here for me. You'll want a hard hat, flashlight, and clothing that covers your skin. but other than that there are some good spots for beginners that I keep going to.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: Any good ones?
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: There are some that require some long drives, like in Birch Canyon, but Rorik's End has a few good ones. Most of the easy ones are by Egg Park.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: Does the smell bother you at all?
		</p>
		<p>
			lschiff: Some, but you can bring nose plugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: Anyone hear about the latest from the Bureau of Sabotage?
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: you mean that their director was found dead?
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: That was a month ago dude, keep up. No, I mean that they're laying off half their staff. 
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: Why?
		</p>
		<p>
			brian.: New director. He's a friend of the mayors and was an executive at Standard Combustion. I got laid off.
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> man. That sucks.
		</p>
		<p>
			eatmyshorts: Any luck finding a new job?
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: Oh awesome, just saw we're getting boards back.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: does that mean that banned users are coming back?
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: I think 5coolbeans would hate that haha
		</p>
		<p>
			MOD: Actually, if anyone's heard from 5coolbeans, lschiff, or brian. let me know. I just put up a bulletin to keep an eye out.
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: huh??? what happened????
		</p>
		<p>
			asdeaf: anyone got plans for this weekend?
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: Hey guys, looks like engounge found a body near Egg Park. They just messaged me:
		</p>
		<p>
			Something is deeply amiss in Rorik's End. As loathe as I am to use its name, Egg Cave lives up to its reputation. It was constructed in 1900 right before the sale to Standard Combustion as a speculation for further iron deposits. All they found was sulfur.
		</p>
		<p>
			Andersen Mining tried to convert the area into some sort of demo area for showing off their mining equipment and processes. <a href="spider/policies">SPNPOLICY200</a> never noticed the smell.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was quickly abandoned after, and it was there that I found myself on a crisp evening. I was enjoying my freedom from the state's grubby paws and wanted to explore this "home away from home" for myself. It's a great cave system for being alone if that's what you need, and so I wanted to take that time for myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wandered around the spot, but everything felt different and wrong. The cave itself had shifted from the very foundations that I was used to. All my usual places were ruined. Something was off, and something was wrong. Not that you could really tell the cave had been split apart and smashed together. Egg Cave still looks like a cave. Just not the one I was used to.
		</p>
		<p>
			I got lost searching through the various new alcoves, when I ran across the body on the ground. Blood was pouring to the floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The body was cold to the touch. I was at least able to fondle the natural handles very nicely, and from the figure it was very clearly a senseless waste of life. I took a closer examination of the corpse and found blood not just on the floor, but blood that had once traveled upwards, to the ceiling in small detail that could not be photographed from afar.
		</p>
		<p>
			And yes, I did take a picture. It didn't capture the full intention of this murder, but it at least shows the body as I had found it. The only detail I could not preserve in the photograph was an iron stake with a goat engraved at the hilt. That, I took for myself. As a memento.
		</p>
		<p>
			And no, I didn't call the police. I wouldn't trust them to catch bird flu at a Hong Kong duck farm. Just remember to stay safe out there, everyone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Everyone may claim the slasher is responsible, but I know in my heart that cruelty of such a nature goes beyond whatever powers lie in the natural realm.
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick, take heed of my word and spread my message. I deserve not to be silenced for this simple truth. Heed my words, protect yourselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			qwer324: i thought engounge was in jail?
		</p>
		<p>
			sedrick: He made bail. And yes, I called the police.
